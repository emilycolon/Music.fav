## List of Features / User Stories

This app allows a user to track their favorite musicians and view a list of all favorite artists. They can also add songs and albums and then view all favorited songs, or all songs (sorted by album) for each favorited artist.

When planning, my Bronze level included allowing the user to track artists and songs. Silver included the ability to track albums. My Gold level project was to also incorporate playback of favorited songs/artists/albums via Spotify. I utilized wire framing, an ERD model, and Trello to handle planning and project management. Documents can be viewed [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/emilycolon/project-2/tree/master/planning).

The deployed app is currently at Silver level. I was able to include basic code to allow my personal Spotify account to recognize the app/web browser as a "device" and remotely control playback through the opened browser. Further Gold level development would include allowing control of the playback in the app itself as well as the ability to see selected songs/artists/albums and have those available for playback.
